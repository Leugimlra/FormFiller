# FormFiller
App to fill out different permit forms used by Marlborough Fire Department
Through a drop down menu, the user will be able to select which form they would like to fill out. 
The interface will change depending on which form it is in order to collect the appropriate information.
Afterwards, a pdf file will be created where the information is written onto the PDF and will give the option to save or print.
